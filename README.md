### Problem Description:  
Magic Tower, is an interesting flash game with lots of strategy decisions and calculation. 
Player control a hero moving in the magic tower, open doors, kill monsters, solve puzzles and finally save the princess.  
In our genetic algorithm project, we simplified this game, only leave the maze part with a key and door puzzle. 
In detail, our algorithm will try to find a key in the maze first, 
then use this key to open a gate and finally find the way to the next level of the tower.
